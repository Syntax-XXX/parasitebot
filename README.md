## Overview

ParasiteBot is a Discord bot that uses advanced AI (via Groq/OpenAI APIs) to clone users' personalities based on their message history â€” but only after users explicitly consent. Users can customize the style of their AI cloneâ€™s responses, control consent, and explore an infection chain that traces who cloned whom.

This bot emphasizes **privacy** by storing all user data locally, deleting messages from non-consenting users, and providing full user control over their data and clone style.

## Features

- **User Consent Management**  
  Users must explicitly accept before their messages are recorded and used for AI cloning.

- **Clone Style Tuner**  
  Choose from different clone communication styles:  
  - `default`  
  - `formal`  
  - `meme`  
  - `toxic`  
  - `uwu`

- **AI-Generated Clone Replies**  
  The bot replies impersonating the user in their chosen style when mentioned.

- **Infection Chain Visualization**  
  Trace the chain of clones showing who cloned whom.

- **Server Status Command**  
  View system health stats (CPU, memory, disk usage, uptime).

- **Consent Revocation**  
  Users can revoke consent anytime to stop data collection.
